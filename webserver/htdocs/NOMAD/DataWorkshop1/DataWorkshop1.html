<h4>Available demos</h4>
<p>
We plan to create various VR demos to highlight the benefits of VR.
</p>
<h5>Running on portable hardware (Vive / Oculus)</h5>
<p>In principle small datasets.<br/>
    1) Visualization of electron density for excitons.<br/>
    Primary dataset: LiF.<br/>
    No time evolution,<br/>
    11x11x11 grid of possible hole positions<br/>

    2) Visualization of electron density for chemical reactions.<br/>
    Primary dataset: CO2 + CaO<br/>
    Time evolution, 423 timesteps<br/>

    3) Visualization of molecular dynamics without electron density; crystal structures 
	(extended xyz files, example dataset crack in Si provided by Gábor Csányi)<br/>

    4) Visualization of Fermi surfaces (x3d files as used internally by encyclopaedia viewer)<br/>

	5) Visualization of crystal structures directly from NOMAD Encyclopaedia<br/>
<h5>Running on room sized devices (CAVE-like)</h5>
<p>In principle larger datasets possible<br/>
    6) Similar demos to 1) to 4), bigger datasets are possible (within reason)</p>
<h5>Running on GearVR:</h5>
<p>
	Demos 3) and 5) above. Simplified version of 2).<br/>
If other datasets are in use by members of NOMAD which were created by similar simulations as the ones described above, 
I would like a copy of the data in advance to integrate it and display during the workshop for study. 
Contact me (garcia at lrz.de).
Other visualizations provided by the encyclopaedia web will be studied for their suitability to VR implementation.
If suitable ones are found, an effort will be made to prepare additional demos. A call for additional compatible datasets will be made.
<br/>
A summary of the current demos, with code, is available <a href="http://mrs-srv.srv.lrz.de/NOMAD/">here</a>

</p>
<p>

3D-Scotty is the configuration which allows 3DScover (genome visualization sofware from the MrSymbioMath project which runs in Linux-PC) to be run without modifications using remote visualization (virtual GL).
My original idea was to use this system, and run Vesta with the correct parameters instead of 3DScover.
Even if we have another system working instead, it would be good to see this one in case it inspires us.
