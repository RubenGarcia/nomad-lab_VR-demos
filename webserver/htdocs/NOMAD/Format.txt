# Regular expression:  * means 0 or more repetitions (additional constraints may apply), space or tab separated
# <X> denotes the type in non-comments (definition of lines)
# <Y> denotes the value of a parsed variable in comments (explanations)

#Number of timesteps T. Default value: 0, or that defined by xyzfile (see below) if it exists
timesteps <int> 

#Number of isos I
#Default value: 0
isos <int>

#Values (after isos parameter): I strings. Default value: "" (empty string)
values <string>*

#Colours (after isos parameter): I*4 floats, rgba [0..1]. Default value: all 1 1 1 1 (white, opaque)

#Translations(after isos parameter): I*3 floats, xyz displacements. Default value: all 0 0 0 (no translation)
translations <float>*

#path P of isosurface files, including file prefix. Needs to include the trailing slash as appropriate.
#Default value: "" (empty string)
path <string>



#xyz atom file AXYZF (extended xyz format) - For backwards compatibility, atomfile is an alias of xyzfile
#If timestep T does not match with the xyz file, the minimum of the two values is used
xyzfile <string>

#Gaussian cube atom file ACUBEF. Only atoms (not volumetric data) are parsed at the moment. Implies timesteps T=1 for now.

#NOMAD integration. Baseurl gives the url where the material json can be downloaded
#by default, the value is "http://enc-testing-nomad.esc.rzg.mpg.de/v1.0/materials/"
baseurl <string>

#NOMAD integration. Jsonurl gives the material url (which is also the material code in the NOMAD encyclopaedia)
#This option downloads the materials from the NOMAD repository
jsonurl <string>

#NOMAD integration. For off-line use. Json provides the base string JSON for the desired, pre-downloaded material
#expected filenames: <JSON>_elements.json, and <JSON>_cells.json

#scaling of atoms, default value: 1. This parameter scales the atom radius. Use 0.45 for compatibility with encyclopaedia.
atomscaling <float>

#This option indicates the simulation is non-periodic and that no replication of atoms at the cell borders should take place
nonperiodic

#This option indicates that the system is periodic and the number of repetitions of the grid and the atoms in the a b c base vector directions
#If this option is different from the default value 1 1 1, atoms in the unit cell border will not be replicated.
repetitions <int> <int> <int>

#In the case of simulation in which all atoms correspond in different timesteps, this is a list of atoms (starting in 1) which should have
#their full trajectory highlighted
#A single value of -1 means all atoms should have trajectories displayed.

#Screenshot numbers are consecutive
#Fast access (SSD) disk strongly suggested to avoid tracking issues when recording. 
#L=Left Eye, R=Right Eye. Only left eye saved at the moment

#User is expected to modify background, screenshot, possibly userpos, possibly colours, possibly atomscaling
#Possibly showtrajectory
#NOMAD integration: Change baseurl to point to a different NOMAD clone, and jsonurl to choose the material

#Other parameters probably will not be changed by final user.
